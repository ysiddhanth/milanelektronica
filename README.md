# THE STROKE - milanelektronica
#### Basically, the simulation in tinkercad, simulates the distance and the button presses as the distance sensor isn't available in the parts list. The serial monitor prints out the distance and the frequency playing at each iteration
#### PS: The simulation code is not the same as the real code for the arduino.
